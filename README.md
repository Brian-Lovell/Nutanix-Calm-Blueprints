# Nutanix-Calm-Blueprints

## Udacity - Hybrid Cloud SaaS: Three-Tier Web Application
Project description
I created a Three-Tier Web Application Nutanix Calm blueprint that has a load balancer, two web tiers, and a database on Nutanix AHV, and Amazon Web Services.

I learned how to use Nutanix Calm blueprints to create a web server tier on private and public cloud. Both are scalable with Calm Variables, and Macros and orchestrates updating the load balancer.

I also learned how to create different application profiles for different resource requirements. Small and medium application profiles for more demanding loads.

Created a database back up and restore action that uses end user runtime specified password for the database root account. Database actions also orchestrate the stop and restart of the web server tier.
